When La Manuela hears Pancho’s truck and whispers, “Ay, es que estoy tan nerviosa,” she names herself in the feminine—nerviosa—a seemingly small grammatical choice that carries significant weight. This moment exemplifies what this project understands as 'mediated self-representation': the emergence of a transfeminine voice within a cinematic and social system structured by machismo, one that simultaneously permits and punishes her intelligibility. Her fear is not abstract or merely psychological; it is historically and socially produced. In rural Mexico, machismo functions as a regulatory regime that organizes gender, desire, and violence, rendering transfeminine presence legible only under threat. Throughout the 1970s, transfeminine figures in Mexican cultural production began to appear as speaking subjects, but always within conditions shaped by masculine dominance, spectacle, and the ever-present possibility of punishment. La Manuela’s fear registers this reality. It is the fear of a social order in which masculinity must constantly reassert itself through control, humiliation, and violence, and in which transfemininity becomes visible only at the edge of annihilation. Pancho’s approach activates not only personal memory of past brutality against her but the broader machista logic that authorizes his power and impunity.By using the feminine to describe her own affective state, La Manuela briefly glitches this system. She speaks herself into being through language, asserting a gendered subjectivity that machismo seeks to deny or discipline. This assertion is immediately undercut by her surroundings—most notably by La Japonesita’s insistence on calling her papá—a reminder that recognition is structurally constrained. The utterance thus holds a double force: it is both an act of self-naming and a survival strategy within a regime that makes transfeminine life precarious. What enters the (discursive) archive here is not stable identity but a trace—fear voiced in the feminine—revealing how transfeminine subjectivity in Mexican cinema emerges in fragments, shaped by machismo’s violence and the constant negotiation of visibility.

When La Manuela tells her daughter, “Esta noche no vamos a poder abrir,” the line registers as more than a practical decision about the brothel’s operations. It signals the anticipatory power of machista violence: Pancho does not need to be present for his authority to structure their actions. Daily life—labor, intimacy, survival—is preemptively suspended in response to the threat he represents. The brothel closes not because violence has occurred, but because it is expected. This moment establishes the film’s central affective economy: fear as a governing force that organizes space, time, and possibility for transfeminine life in rural Mexico. Before Pancho enters the frame, his masculinity already dictates what can and cannot happen. The film opens, then, not with action but with constraint—revealing how machismo operates less as episodic brutality than as a continuous regime that disciplines bodies in advance.

From its opening moments, El lugar sin límites establishes space as an active force. At 3:18, the brothel is introduced not only as a setting but as a character in its own right: camp, cutre, decadent, and dimly lit. Its worn fabrics, cramped interiors, and excessive ornamentation mark it as a feminized, marginal space—one saturated with intimacy and moral ambiguity. This is the space where the film’s action will unfold, and its cutre aesthetic prefigures the conditions under which transfeminine visibility can occur. The brothel stages a world where gender is already theatrical, where respectability is suspended, and where desire circulates in coded, unstable ways.	It is within this environment that the fiesta emerges as the film’s most volatile stage. El lugar sin límites turns the fiesta into the site where a transfeminine figure is momentarily centered, celebrated, and spectacularized. In Ripstein’s film, fiesta is never free of menace. It is the space where the terms of Manuela’s legibility are violently negotiated. Her dance—central to how she is read as a woman—is also what renders her vulnerable to the men whose desire must be disavowed through ridicule, aggression, and performances of hypermasculinity. Abuse becomes part of the act itself.	By the middle of the film, a flashback introduces the day Manuela arrived in town. If the first part of the movie establishes the characters, the middle introduces the past itself: how the brothel came to be, and how it deteriorated after the town’s cacique cut off its electricity. The withdrawal of power functions as economic coercion—if the owners sold, he would acquire the property and eventually sell the entire town to a transnational company. The brothel, as a character, bears the consequences of the cacique’s pursuit of greater money and power, collapsing alongside the town itself.	The flashback stages the first fiesta in which Manuela dances inside the brothel. The space is lively and full: singers, loud live music, people dancing, bodies pressed together. During this sequence, after the men “accept” Manuela—dancing with her, touching her, grabbing her sexually—they escort her to the river, strip her naked, and laugh as they expose her body. She celebrates this moment. The scene resonates with the logic of Lorca’s La casada infiel—“y yo que me la llevé al río creyendo que era…”—but here the fantasy of seduction collapses into brutal recognition. One man remarks of Manuela: “Resultó que no era hembra” (1:07:19). Desire, in retrospect, is reclassified as error. The body is retroactively rendered illegible once recognition threatens masculine coherence.	Water becomes both baptism and threat: a space where the town briefly admits its enchantment before violently reasserting its power. Ultimately, the fiesta reveals the rural sex/gender regime that structures the terms of Manuela’s presence. Her visibility is permissible only under tightly coded conditions—within drunken festivity, within the collective performance of masculine dominance, within a space where her body can be consumed as spectacle but not acknowledged as a desiring or desired subject. She is allowed to occupy the center only insofar as she does not disrupt the public/private division that protects queer male desire from exposure. The celebration thus stages her precarity: she shines, but only under the constant threat of humiliation, violence, and erasure.
