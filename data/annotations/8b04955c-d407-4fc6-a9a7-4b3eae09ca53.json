The fiesta, already a space where the sex/gender system loosens under alcohol and spectacle, becomes a contested arena in which Manuela briefly pushes back against the terms of her intelligibility. Her body continues to be celebrated as spectacle—desired, admired, consumed—yet this visibility is always shadowed by the threat of reclassification. The response “joto sí, degenerado no” crystallizes the double bind of her presence: she can be seen, but only if she manages the names through which she is read. What the scene reveals is not liberation, but a fragile, tactical survival within a linguistic economy where being named is inseparable from being exposed."
