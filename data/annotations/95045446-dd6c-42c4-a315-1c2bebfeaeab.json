This moment exemplifies what this project understands as 'mediated self-representation': the emergence of a transfeminine voice within a cinematic and social system structured by machismo, one that simultaneously permits and punishes her intelligibility. Her fear is not abstract or merely psychological; it is historically and socially produced. In rural Mexico, machismo functions as a regulatory regime that organizes gender, desire, and violence, rendering transfeminine presence legible only under threat. "}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Throughout the 1970s, transfeminine figures in Mexican cultural production began to appear as speaking subjects, but always within conditions shaped by masculine dominance, spectacle, and the ever-present possibility of punishment. La Manuela’s fear registers this reality. It is the fear of a social order in which masculinity must constantly reassert itself through control, humiliation, and violence, and in which transfemininity becomes visible only at the edge of annihilation. Pancho’s approach activates not only personal memory of past brutality against her but the broader machista logic that authorizes his power and impunity."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"By using the feminine to describe her own affective state, La Manuela briefly glitches this system. She speaks herself into being through language, asserting a gendered subjectivity that machismo seeks to deny or discipline. This assertion is immediately undercut by her surroundings—most notably by La Japonesita’s insistence on calling her papá—a reminder that recognition is structurally constrained. The utterance thus holds a double force: it is both an act of self-naming and a survival strategy within a regime that makes transfeminine life precarious. What enters the (discursive) archive here is not stable identity but a trace—fear voiced in the feminine—revealing how transfeminine subjectivity in Mexican cinema emerges in fragments, shaped by machismo’s violence and the constant negotiation of visibility."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Opening scene","tag":"Rurality and queernes"}],"uuid":"664d7a6a-ef19-41ff-89fa-1d4083aad916"},{"start_time":277,"end_time":0,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"When La Manuela tells her daughter, “Esta noche no vamos a poder abrir,” the line registers as more than a practical decision about the brothel’s operations. It signals the anticipatory power of machista violence: Pancho does not need to be present for his authority to structure their actions. Daily life—labor, intimacy, survival—is preemptively suspended in response to the threat he represents. The brothel closes not because violence has occurred, but because it is expected. This moment establishes the film’s central affective economy: fear as a governing force that organizes space, time, and possibility for transfeminine life in rural Mexico. Before Pancho enters the frame, his masculinity already dictates what can and cannot happen. The film opens, then, not with action but with constraint—revealing how machismo operates less as episodic brutality than as a continuous regime that disciplines bodies in advance."}]}],"tags":[],"uuid":"bc7893bc-03b6-4499-a267-2e04dd5f57c3"},{"start_time":198,"end_time":0,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"From its opening moments, "},{"text":"El lugar sin límites","italic":true},{"text":" establishes space as an active force.

If the first part of the movie establishes the characters, the middle introduces the past itself: how the brothel came to be, and how it deteriorated after the town’s cacique cut off its electricity. The withdrawal of power functions as economic coercion—if the owners sold, he would acquire the property and eventually sell the entire town to a transnational company. The brothel, as a character, bears the consequences of the cacique’s pursuit of greater money and power, collapsing alongside the town itself."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"\tThe flashback stages the first fiesta in which Manuela dances inside the brothel.

Ultimately, the fiesta reveals the rural sex/gender regime that structures the terms of Manuela’s presence.
