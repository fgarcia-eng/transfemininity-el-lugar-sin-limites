Ripstein notes that the controversy extended beyond the screen: the director, actors, and crew were subjected to public scrutiny and hostility, revealing how the film’s challenge to sexual and gender norms exceeded cinematic boundaries and entered the realm of social offense."

In this climate, the onscreen kiss was not read as narrative gesture or melodramatic device, but as a provocation—an intolerable visualization of queer desire that violated the tacit separation between what could be known and what could be publicly shown.
