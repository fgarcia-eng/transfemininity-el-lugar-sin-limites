The project began with the manuscript of José Donoso’s novel, which at one point was slated to be adapted by Luis Buñuel—the Spanish filmmaker whose international reputation by the 1960s and 70s had already secured his place as a central figure in modern cinema. Buñuel ultimately chose not to direct the adaptation, a decision that left the project suspended until Ripstein took it up under markedly different conditions."

Yet this emergence occurred under severe material and institutional constraints. Ripstein describes a production environment shaped by cultural politics that deprioritized projects deemed morally or socially risky: limited funding, lack of technical resources, and restricted access to equipment all conditioned what could be filmed and how. The producer’s insistence on casting alternative actors further underscores the instability of the project, as commercial viability repeatedly came into tension with representational risk."
