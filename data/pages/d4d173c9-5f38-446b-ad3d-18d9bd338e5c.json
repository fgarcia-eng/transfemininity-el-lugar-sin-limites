The film captures the precariousness, visibility, and resilience of transfeminine life in rural Mexico, tracing how trans* representation itself becomes a terrain of negotiation, conflict, and fleeting liberation. "

The film enacts what I call mediated self-representation: a mode in which La Manuela appears to articulate her own desires, vulnerabilities, and subjectivity, even as her voice is filtered through cisgender authorship, melodramatic conventions, and the institutional frameworks of 1970s Mexican cinema. This delicate tension—between expression and mediation—marks a decisive shift in how cinema could represent transfeminine life. At the heart of this shift lies a paradox: the visibility of trans* subjects is made possible only through the very frameworks—spectacle, eroticization, and violence—that render them simultaneously compelling and disposable. The introductory entries in this AVAnnotate exhibit trace the cultural, political, and aesthetic conditions that shaped these representational choices, mapping how discourses of nationalism, virility, and modernity defined the fragile boundaries of gender legibility.     "

Russell’s “glitch” is understood here not as a technological error but as a cultural and representational rupture that exposes the instability of normative gender regimes. By combining these frameworks, I can examine how La Manuela articulates her subjectivity within layers of mediation—narrative conventions, melodramatic codes, and the institutional frameworks of 1970s Mexican cinema—that both enable and constrain visibility. In this film, transfeminine legibility emerges not as a fixed identity but through traces and ruptures: moments when gender variance slips beyond the scripts that would contain it, becoming hypervisible, precarious, and affectively charged. Attending to these ephemerality and glitches highlights the ways the film negotiates trans* presence, showing how La Manuela speaks and acts from within a cultural landscape structured by nationalism, moral anxiety, and cinematic spectacle (sex/gender system). This approach situates the film within the broader visual and cultural genealogy of late-1970s Mexico, where queer visibility appeared unevenly, fleetingly, and always through negotiation between expression and constraint.    "

Like earlier representational “glitches,” the film’s treatment of transfemininity functions as a historically contingent rupture, shifting in form alongside evolving social and aesthetic logics. Figures who might previously have been portrayed as grotesque or purely comedic, prior to Ripstein’s film, begin to appear as tragic, eroticized, or capable of narrating their own desires; each iteration illuminates both the possibilities and the limits of representation. La Manuela embodies this rupture: she articulates a fragile, mediated subjectivity legible only through the conventions of melodrama, the pressures of transphobic violence, and the imperatives of nationalist discourse. Her presence enacts the glitch itself—the moment when the representational system falters, straining to contain what it has historically excluded—and in doing so reveals both the instability of gendered narrative forms and the structural violence that sustains them. By attending closely to the film, we glimpse one of the earliest cinematic articulations of trans* existence in Mexico, preserving traces of life and subjectivity that conventional archives have often erased."
